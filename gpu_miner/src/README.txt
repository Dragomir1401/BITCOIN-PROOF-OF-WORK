# Proof of Work Bitcoding implementation in CUDA

------------------------------------ Structure------------------------------------------------------------

    The project is structured in the following way:

    - gpu_miner
        - include
            -sha256.cuh (header file for the sha256 implementation)
            -utils.cuh (header file for the utils)
        - src
            -sha256.cu (source file for the sha256 implementation)
            -utils.cu (source file for the utils)
            -gpu_miner.cu (source file for the main implementation)


------------------------------------ Implementation-------------------------------------------------------

    The implementation follows the model of a cpu iterative implementation of the proof of work algorithm.
The main difference is that the implementation is done in parallel on the GPU. The main idea is to generate
a nonce capable to generate a hash that has a certain number of leading zeros. The implementation is done
in the following way:

    - The main function hashes texts
    - Then it allocates memory on the GPU for the block hash and the block content
    - It copies the block content to the GPU
    - It Calculates the block content based on the previous hash and the top hash
    - Then it creates the grid and block dimensions
    - It starts the timer and calls the kernel function
    - After the kernel function finishes, it stops the timer and copies the result back to the CPU
    - The final step is to print the result and free the memory

    The kernel function is implemented in the following way:

    - It first check if another thread has already found the solution
    - Then it calculates the thread index
    - It converts the thread index to a string as nonce
    - It creates a local block content where it copies the block content to not influence other threads
    - It creates a local block hash where it stores the hash of the block content
    - It checks if the hash has the required number of leading zeros
    - If it has, it sets the solution found flag to true and stores the nonce in the global memory
    - Then it returns


    
-------------------------------------Comments-------------------------------------------------------------

    The implementation is done in a way that is very similar to the CPU implementation. The main difference
is that the memory is allocated on the GPU and the kernel function is called in parallel. The hard part
was to understand how to allocate memory on the GPU and how to correctly apply the hashing function.


-------------------------------------Testing--------------------------------------------------------------

    To test the implementation you can use local CUDA or the cluster using the makefile.


-------------------------------------Results--------------------------------------------------------------

    The hash that is first found is: 00000466c22e6ee57f6ec5a8122e67f82a381499a4b3069869819639bb22a2ee
    The nonce that was found is: 515800
    The time it took to find the solution is: 0.01 seconds

    The results has 5 leading zeros as intended. The hash of the content was tested using an online tool
and it was correct. The time it took to find the solution was very fast, under 0.01 seconds.

-------------------------------------Feedback-------------------------------------------------------------

    The project was very interesting and I learned a something about how the proof of work algorithm works.
The assignment itself was quite simple and did not test many of the concepts from the laboratory. However,
it was a good practice for basic CUDA programming. I would have liked to see more complex assignments that
test more of the concepts learned in the laboratory.

    The algorithm itself sound very complex, but the solution is not that complex. I think it is suitable if
the target is to let more students solve it. Was pretty hard to test on the cluster, since a scp script was
needed to copy the files to the cluster, but that is just my problem because I cant run locally.
